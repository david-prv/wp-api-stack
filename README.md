# wp-api-stack

An extremely reduced implementation of the WordPress API stack

Based on [BackPress](https://backpress.org), this "fake API" is meant to be used in the context of WordPress plugin fuzzing. The minimal design allows for huge performance improvements.

At this time, only specific plugins can be supported. The support is highly limited.
